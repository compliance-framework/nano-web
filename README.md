# nano-web

Hyper-minimal single binary gzipping webserver for serving static content based on labstack echo-server. Based on alpine.

Has SPA mode which includes runtime templating of vite environment variables.

Serves from `/public`

# Config as ENV

- `PORT` The port to listen on. Defaults to `80`
- `SPA_MODE` when set to `1` 404 request will return `/public/index.html` as a `200`.
- `CONFIG_PREFIX` will set the prefix to scan environment variables in order to enable runtime config. Defaults to `VITE_`

# Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile

FROM ghcr.io/compliance-framework/nano-web:latest
COPY ./dist /public/
ENV PORT=8081
ENV SPA_MODE=1

```

# Runtime config for SPAs

**THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR STORING SECRETS, ALL VARIABLES WILL BE PUBLIC TO CLIENT**

If are using `SPA_MODE` and you have set `CONFIG_PREFIX`, or use variables starting with `VITE_` by default, the server will
allow injection of environment variables at runtime, which is useful for configuring dynamically changing API urls, client IDs,
etc, in a dynamically scaling/routing environment such as Kubernetes.

Here's an example `index.html` that utilises this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="cf">
  <head>
    <script>
      window.RUNTIME_ENV = "{{.EscapedJson}}";
    </script>
  </head>
</html>
```

And your client side TS which is safe to be bundled:

```typescript
let runtimeEnv: Record<string, string> = {};
try {
  runtimeEnv = JSON.parse((window as any).RUNTIME_ENV ?? "{}");
} catch {
  // do nothing
}
```

In this way, you can reference these variables that can be set when the container is spun-up.
